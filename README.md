# kafkarealtimestreaming

Implemented an end-to-end data engineering project leveraging Kafka for real-time analysis of Stock Market data. Utilized AWS EC2 for Kafka server, with a producer simulating real-time CSV data. The consumer, integrated with Jupyter Python, processed and stored data in an S3 bucket. Automated data processing, transformation, and querying via Glue crawler job into database and Athena, ensuring seamless real-time analytics on it.
